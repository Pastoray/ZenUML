# ZenUML System Design Examples

> Note: This entire README.md document was also generated by the main contributor to this project, Rida.

This repository hosts a collection of sequence diagrams and system design patterns created using **ZenUML**.

The project serves as a reference for modeling various business processes, network protocols, and software architectures using the Diagram-as-Code approach.

## 📂 Project Structure

The repository is organized by **Contributor** and then by **Example Number**.

```text
examples/
├── {contributor_name}/       # Directory for a specific contributor
│   ├── example1/             # Specific example folder
│   │   ├── {name}.zenuml     # The DSL source file
│   │   ├── {name}.png        # Rendered image of the diagram
│   │   └── {name}.java       # Java code sketch/pseudo-code
│   ├── example2/
│   └── ...
```

Each example folder is self-contained and provides:

1. **Visual Representation:** A `.png` export of the diagram.

2. **Source Code:** A `.zenuml` file containing the DSL.

3. **Implementation Context:** A `.java` file containing the code sketch or logic being modeled.

## 🛠️ How to Use

### Viewing Diagrams

* **Quick View:** Open the `.png` file in any image viewer or browser.

* **Edit/Analyze:** Open the `.zenuml` file. You can render it using:

  * The [ZenUML](https://app.zenuml.com/) Online Editor.

  * The **ZenUML Extension** for VS Code or IntelliJ IDEA.

### For New Contributors

1. Create a directory with your name under `examples/`.

2. Create a new folder for your example (e.g., `example1`).

3. Include the `.zenuml` source, a generated `.png`, and the reference `.java` sketch.

4. Update this README
